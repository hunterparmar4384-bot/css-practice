      <p>A river is a natural stream of fresh water that flows on land or inside caves towards another body of water at a lower elevation, such as an ocean, lake, or another river. A river may run dry before reaching the end of its course if it runs out of water, or only flow during certain seasons. Rivers are regulated by the water cycle, the processes by which water moves around the Earth. Water first enters rivers through precipitation, whether from rainfall, the runoff of water down a slope, the melting of glaciers or snow, or seepage from aquifers beneath the surface of the Earth.</p>

         <p>A paragraph is a distinct section of writing, composed of several sentences, that develops a single main idea or topic, helping to organize text and guide readers through an author's thoughts; it typically starts with an indentation or a line break and contains a topic sentence introducing the idea, supported by details, examples, or explanations. Paragraphs are crucial for breaking down complex information into manageable chunks, making writing clearer and easier to follow. </p>
